The Interactive Cloud OS isn't dead!


The work is going on and I will publish a new version with OpenStack Havana as soon as possible. Currently I set up all needed infrastructure, needed for creating the distribution. As the Interactive Cloud OS was OpenSource before, it will remain OpenSource. But this time, the infrastructure will be OpenSource too! I'll publish some code soon...


While forking the Interactive Cloud OS, the name changed to "Cloudversity Core OS". This is a strategy change, but won't purpose any change in the functionality or behavior of the OS.


I'm very open for all kind of contributions! So feel free to contact me, if you like to contribute to the project... just write an email to wolf@os-forge.net


More information will follow soon!


Have a nice day! :-)


Tony

# Why another Linux distribution
---------------------------------

* distributions currently don't treat their distribution as one piece of software
    * they are buried with unconsistently created packages
    * are unable to understand what really happens with their full-stack distribution if they update a particular package
    * analysing their package-data deeply, is very hard
    * they don't collect data about their packages in a reusable format
    * their build process is not 100% automated, so they can't takle changes in an easy and predictable way
    * tests are difficult to make
    * improvements are slow in spreading over all packages
    * package quality lacks


# How is ssistentLOS different?
--------------------------------

* 100% automated builds, over the complete distibution
* there are standards for each package, until these standards match, the package won't be published
* there are tools for package maintainers to help, meet the standards
* there are easy assistent tools / libs to automate all aspects of the services like an assistent to setup an OpenStack server or a customized version of ssistentLOS
* there is a huge focus on performance within the assistents, so you can test your ideas easily and quickly
